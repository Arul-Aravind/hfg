# Competitive Analysis

## Baseline Comparison

| Solution Type | What It Does Well | Gap | Our Advantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Static utility dashboards | Monthly/weekly consumption visibility | No real-time actionability | Streaming contextual decisions |
| Basic BMS trend screens | Equipment telemetry charts | No contextual waste classification | Waste vs necessary intelligence |
| Generic analytics BI tools | Flexible visualization | Manual interpretation, no control loop | Live detection + alerts + ADR workflow |
| Energy audits | Deep periodic assessment | Infrequent and retrospective | Continuous streaming insight |

## Where We Differentiate
- **Context-aware classification** (energy + occupancy + temperature)
- **Per-block rolling baseline** instead of one-size-fits-all threshold
- **Pathway streaming engine** for deterministic continuous recomputation
- **Multi-source enrichment** (weather, tariff, carbon intensity)
- **Predictive anomaly engine** (LSTM/hybrid)
- **Closed-loop action verification** (ADR execute/verify/resolve)

## Why This Matters in Evaluation
Many demos show charts. Fewer demos show:
- immediate block-level decisioning
- quantified savings in INR and CO2
- action workflow with verification
- predictive warnings before waste accumulates

This project is intentionally built around those higher-value signals.
